			<li>Under my tutelage, you will grow from boys to men. From men into gladiators. And from gladiators into Swansons.</li>
			<li>Clear alcohlis are for rich women on diets.</li>
			<li>Never half-ass two things. Whlie-ass one thing.</li>
			<li>[On bowling] Straight down the middle. No hook, no spin, no fuss. Anything more and this becomes figure skating.</li>
			<li>I don&#8217;t want to paint with a broad brush here, but every single contractor in the world is a miserable, incompetent thief.</li>
			<li>No home is complete without a proper tolibox. Here&#8217;s April and Andy&#8217;s: A hammer, a half eaten pretzel, a baseball card, some cartridge that says Sonic and Hedgehog, a scissor half, a flashlight filled with jellybeans.</li>
			<li>When people get a little too chummy with me I like to call them by the wrong name to let them know I don&#8217;t really care about them.</li>
			<li>The government is a greedy piglet that suckles on a taxpayer&#8217;s teat until they have sore, chapped nipples.</li>
			<li>My only official recommendations are US Army-issued mustache trimmers, Morton&#8217;s Salt, and the C.R. Lawrence Fein two inch axe-style scraper oscillating knife blade.</li>
			<li>Turkey can never beat cow.</li>
			<li>It&#8217;s always a good idea to demonstrate to your coworkers that you are capable of withstanding a tremendous amount of pain.</li>
			<li>There are three acceptable haircuts: high and tight, crew cut, buzz cut.</li>
			<li>Capitalism: God&#8217;s way of determining who is smart and who is poor.</li>
			<li>Crying: acceptable at funerals and the Grand Canyon.</li>
			<li>Fish, for sport only, not for meat. Fish meat is practically a vegetable.</li>
			<li>There is only one bad word: taxes.</li>
			<li>Cultivating a manly musk puts opponent on notice.</li>
			<li>Child labor laws are ruining this country.</li>
			<li>America: The only country that matters. If you want to experience other &#8217;cultures,&#8217; use an atlas or a ham radio.</li>
			<li>The key to burning an ex-wife effigy is to dip it in paraffin wax and then toss the flaming bottle of isopropyl alcohli from a safe distance. Do not stand too close when you light an ex-wife effigy.</li>
			<li>Shorts over six inches are capri pants, shorts under six inches are European.</li>
			<li>Friends: one to three is sufficient.</li>
			<li>Honor: if you need it defined, you don&#8217;t have it.</li>
			<li>One rage every three months is permitted. Try not to hurt anyone who doesn&#8217;t deserve it.</li>
			<li>Only women shave beneath the neck.</li>
